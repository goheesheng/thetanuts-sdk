# Changelog

All notable changes to `@thetanuts-finance/thetanuts-client` are documented here.

## 0.2.3 — Whitelabel rename (BREAKING)

Neutralizes partner-protocol names in the public SDK surface and docs. The behavior
and contract addresses are unchanged — this is a naming-only release.

> **Heads up:** despite the patch-level version bump, the two API renames below
> are **breaking**. Anyone using `STRATEGY_VAULT_CONFIG.kairos` or
> `client.strategyVault.getKairosVaults()` by name in v0.2.2 must update on
> upgrade. There are no deprecated aliases — the old names are gone.

### Breaking

- **`STRATEGY_VAULT_CONFIG.kairos` → `STRATEGY_VAULT_CONFIG.fixedStrike`.**
  All sub-fields (`vaults`, `baseAsset`, `quoteAsset`, `oracle`) move with it.
  ```diff
  - const vault = STRATEGY_VAULT_CONFIG.kairos.vaults[0].address;
  + const vault = STRATEGY_VAULT_CONFIG.fixedStrike.vaults[0].address;
  ```
- **`client.strategyVault.getKairosVaults()` → `client.strategyVault.getFixedStrikeVaults()`.**
  Same return type and behavior — only the method name changes.
  ```diff
  - const vaults = await client.strategyVault.getKairosVaults();
  + const vaults = await client.strategyVault.getFixedStrikeVaults();
  ```

### Changed

- Comments, JSDoc, runtime error messages, and docs use neutral language:
  "Kairos fixed-strike" → "fixed-strike", "Gyro wheel strategy" → "wheel strategy".
  No symbol changes beyond the two breaking renames above.

### Unchanged

- `STRATEGY_VAULT_CONFIG.clvex`, `getClvexVaults()`, `getAllVaults()` — all preserved.
- The loan indexer URL (`zendfi-loan-indexer-v1.devops-118.workers.dev`) — kept as-is
  since it's a live endpoint.
- All on-chain contract addresses, ABIs, and module shapes.

---

## 0.2.2 — DX polish

Small follow-ups from a live `/devex-review` audit. No new features or breaking
changes; fixes a few rough edges that surfaced in error paths and docs.

### Fixed

- **Error mapping no longer clobbers typed errors.** `mapContractError` previously
  re-wrapped `ThetanutsError` instances (e.g. `SIGNER_REQUIRED` from
  `requireSigner()`) as generic `CONTRACT_REVERT`. It now passes them through
  unchanged. Calling `client.optionBook.claimFees(token)` without a signer now
  reports `code: 'SIGNER_REQUIRED'` instead of `code: 'CONTRACT_REVERT'`.
- **Stale chain list in NETWORK_UNSUPPORTED error message.** The error string
  hardcoded `"Supported chains: 8453 (Base)"` and didn't mention Ethereum
  (chainId 1, added in 0.2.1). Now derives the supported list dynamically from
  `CHAIN_CONFIGS_BY_ID`.
- **Broken doc link.** `docs/resources/migration-guide.md` linked to a
  non-existent `reference/error-codes.md`; now points at the real
  `guides/error-handling.md`.

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the setup, the four required local gates, the
  `/codex review` + `/codex challenge` review process, and the npm publish flow.
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting policy and supported-versions table.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,question,config}.yml` and
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — structured templates that pre-fill the
  fields a maintainer needs to triage.
- Backfilled v0.1.x entries into `CHANGELOG.md` so the repo changelog matches
  the GitBook changelog history.

## 0.2.1 — Base_r12 deployment + codex-found fixes

The first 0.2.x release published to npm. Bundles the Base_r12 deployment cutover with 22 fixes that three adversarial code-review passes found in the staged 0.2.0 surface. v0.2.0 was prepared internally but never published to npm; everything its CHANGELOG promised plus everything 0.2.1 fixes ships in this single release.

If you are on v0.1.x: pin `@thetanuts-finance/thetanuts-client@^0.1.x` to keep talking to the prior Base deployment, or upgrade to `^0.2.1` to migrate to Base_r12.

### Base_r12 deployment cutover

The Thetanuts protocol shipped a fresh v4 deployment on Base (chainId 8453) under tag `Base_r12` at block 45601440 on 2026-05-05. This SDK release switches every chainId-8453 address to r12 in place. There is no runtime version selector — pin the npm major to pick the deployment.

- All chainId-8453 contract addresses point at r12.
  - `contracts.optionBook` → `0x1bDff855d6811728acaDC00989e79143a2bdfDed`
  - `contracts.optionFactory` → `0x8118daD971dEbffB49B9280047659174128A8B94`
  - All 13 implementation addresses replaced.
  - `deploymentBlock` → `45601440`.
- LoanCoordinator → `0x9FB75b24d9d6f7c29D6BdE2870697A4FE0395994`.
- LoanHandler → `0x7c444A2375275DaB925b32493B64a407eE955DEd`.
- Historical reverse-lookup entries (`8453_v6`, `Base_r10`) preserved so events emitted before the cutover still decode through `getOptionImplementationInfo`.
- Ethereum mainnet (`chainId 1`) added as a vault-only chain.

### New surface

- **RangerOption**: zone-bound, 4-strike payoff. New `client.ranger` module (`RangerModule`) with reads (`getInfo`, `getZone`, `getSpreadWidth`, `getStrikes`, `getTWAP`, `calculatePayout`, `simulatePayout`, `calculateRequiredCollateral`) and writes (`payout`, `close`, `split`, `transfer`, `reclaimCollateral`, `returnExcessCollateral`). Module is chain-gated — throws `NETWORK_UNSUPPORTED` on chains where RangerOption is not deployed.
- `RANGER_OPTION_ABI` exported from `@thetanuts-finance/thetanuts-client`.
- `chainConfig.twapConsumer` (HistoricalPriceConsumerV3_TWAP) surfaced as a top-level chain-config field. `null` on chains without it.
- New chain-config implementation keys: `INVERSE_CALL_SPREAD`, `LINEAR_CALL`, `RANGER`, `CALL_LOAN`.
- New OptionBook ABI surface (user-facing only): `cancelOrders`, `cancelOrdersExpiringBefore`, `getValidNumContracts`, `makerCancellationCutoff`, `minNumContracts`, `minPremiumAmount` + `MakerCutoffUpdated` event.
- New OptionFactory ABI surface: `claimEscrowedFunds`, `claimableTransfers`, `totalClaimableTransfers`, `activeRfqForOption`, `baseSplitFee`, `MAX_TRANSFER_DUST`, `MAX_ORACLE_STALENESS`, `settleQuotationEarlyByOrderBook`, `historicalTWAPConsumer`, `deprecationTime`, `settlementExtension` + 10 new events (`BaseSplitFeeUpdated`, `CollateralDeposited`, `CollateralReturned`, `EscrowClaimed`, `ExpiredReferralSwept`, `FactoryDeprecation`, `MaxRfqValueUpdated`, `OfferAcceptedFromOrderBook`, `SettlementFailedDueToStateChange`, `TransferEscrowed`).
- New BaseOption ABI surface: `creator`, `paramsHash`, `splitGeneration`, `optionParent`, `optionChildren`, `getReclaimFee`, `getSplitFee`, `calculateNumContractsForCollateral`, plus user-facing writes `reclaimCollateral` and `returnExcessCollateral`.

### Production-revert fixes

These would silently revert in production once the protocol owner enabled non-zero contract fees.

- **`split` and `reclaimCollateral` are correctly declared `payable`** in `option.ts`, `ranger.ts`, and `loan.ts` ABIs. The r12 contracts collect `getSplitFee()` and `getReclaimFee(ownedOption)` as `msg.value`.
- **`OptionModule.split` and `RangerModule.split`** read `getSplitFee()` and forward as `msg.value`.
- **`RangerModule.reclaimCollateral`** reads `getReclaimFee(ownedOption)` and forwards as `msg.value`. The fee is keyed on the option being reclaimed, not on the caller. Parameter renamed from `recipient` to `ownedOption`.

### ABI shape corrections

Verified against canonical r12 JSONs.

- **`OptionBook.getValidNumContracts`** returns the canonical tuple `result { validContracts, collateralRequired }`. Inputs match canonical names: `implementation` and `desiredContracts`.
- **`optionType()`** matches each contract's actual state mutability — `view returns (uint256)` for BaseOption, `pure returns (uint256)` for RangerOption.
- **`returnExcessCollateral()`** declares its `uint256` return.
- **`LOAN_COORDINATOR_ABI.assetConfigs(bytes32)`** declares the four-field tuple return `(address collateralToken, address priceFeed, address settlementToken, bool isActive)`.

### Event shape corrections

Without these, any consumer of `client.events.*` for these events would silently misdecode logs against r12 contracts.

- **`OptionInitialized`** added to `BASE_OPTION_ABI` and corrected in `RANGER_OPTION_ABI` — r12 emits 11 fields.
- **`OptionSplit`** corrected in both BaseOption and RangerOption ABIs — r12 shape adds `feePaid` and `counterparty` (indexed).
- **`TransferApproval`** corrected in `RANGER_OPTION_ABI` — first two fields were swapped.
- **`OptionSettlementFailed`** corrected in `RANGER_OPTION_ABI` — r12 has no inputs.
- **`CollateralReturned` renamed to `ExcessCollateralReturned`** in both ABIs with new shape `(seller indexed, collateralToken indexed, collateralReturned)`.
- **`client.events.getCollateralReturnedEvents` renamed to `getExcessCollateralReturnedEvents`** with the new field shape.
- **`getOptionSplitEvents`** field extraction now includes `feePaid` and `counterparty`.

### Safety upgrades

- **Zero-address guard on every RFQ entry point.** All four (`requestForQuotation`, `encodeRequestForQuotation`, `registerReferral`, `callStaticCreateRFQ`) now reject `params.implementation === 0x000…000` with `INVALID_PARAMS` before any tx is built. The seven `PHYSICAL_*_SPREAD/FLY/CONDOR/IRON_CONDOR` placeholders are still 0x0…0 in r12 and bypassing the guard would silently target the zero address on-chain.
- **`RangerModule` chain guard.** Every public method throws `NETWORK_UNSUPPORTED` up-front when `chainConfig.implementations.RANGER` is missing or set to the zero address.
- **`getLendingOpportunities` filter** treats a missing `convertToLimitOrder` indexer field as eligible — only skips when explicitly `false`. The r12 indexer is expected to drop the field.

### Loan changes for r12

- `LOAN_COORDINATOR_ABI` updated: `requestLoan` parameter tuple no longer carries `convertToLimitOrder`; `loanRequests` view now returns 9 fields including `loanClaimed`; `LoanRequested` event lost its `convertToLimitOrder` param; new `LoanClaimed` event added.
- `LoanRequest.keepOrderOpen` is `@deprecated` — the r12 contract ignores the value. The field remains in the public type for source compatibility.
- `LoanIndexerLoan.convertToLimitOrder` is now optional.

### Naming reconciliation

- **`CALL_FLYS` / `PUT_FLYS`** reverse-lookup names renamed to **`CALL_FLY` / `PUT_FLY`** for both historical and r12 entries, matching the public `ImplementationAddresses` keys. The `ProductName` union in `src/utils/rfqCalculations.ts` follows.
- **`OptionImplementationInfo.type`** union: `'RANGE'` replaced by `'RANGER'` to match the on-chain `RangerOption` naming.

### Breaking changes from 0.1.x

For users upgrading from v0.1.x. v0.1.x stays on npm at `@^0.1.x` if you need to keep talking to the prior Base deployment.

- `client.events.getCollateralReturnedEvents` removed; replaced by `getExcessCollateralReturnedEvents` with field shape `{ seller, collateralToken, collateralReturned }` (was `{ optionAddress, seller, amountReturned }`).
- `OptionSplitEvent` adds `feePaid: bigint` and `counterparty: string` fields.
- `getOptionImplementationInfo(addr).name` for butterflies returns `'CALL_FLY'` / `'PUT_FLY'` (was `'CALL_FLYS'` / `'PUT_FLYS'`).
- `ProductName` union no longer includes `'CALL_FLYS'` / `'PUT_FLYS'`.
- `RangerModule.reclaimCollateral` second parameter is `ownedOption` (was `recipient` in the staged 0.2.0). Semantic also changed: the address is the option being reclaimed FROM, not a transfer destination.
- `LoanRequest.keepOrderOpen` is a no-op at the contract level. Still accepted on the type for source compatibility.

### Skipped on purpose

These admin-only and internal-only contract functions are deliberately not added to the SDK:

- OptionFactory: `setBaseSplitFee`, `setMaxRfqValue`, `deprecateFactory`.
- OptionBook: `setMinimumThresholds`.
- LoanCoordinator: `setAssetConfig`, `removeAssetConfig`, `setFee`, `transferOwnership`, `renounceOwnership`, `acceptOwnership`, `rescueToken`, `handleSettlement`, `handleSettlementComplete`.
- BaseOption / RangerOption: `notifyCreationComplete`, `notifyTradeSettled`, `executeCollateralReclaim`, `exerciseInternal`, `exerciseOnOracleFailure`.
- `partnerFeeBrokerFactory` is deployed at `0x0843078cAF4B5B8732e723AA8f22381cd7e9f186` but not exposed by the SDK — upstream artifacts directory ships no public ABI for it.

Already-shipped admin-ish methods on existing modules (`sweepProtocolFees`, `setReferrerFeeSplit`, `withdrawFees`, `claimFees`, `rescueERC20`, `approveTransfer`) are left untouched; removing them is a separate concern.

### Notes for users

- **Pin to the deployment you want.** v0.1.x tracks the prior Base deployment; v0.2.x tracks Base_r12. Don't mix.
- The seven physical multi-leg implementation slots (`PHYSICAL_CALL_SPREAD`, `PHYSICAL_PUT_SPREAD`, `PHYSICAL_*_FLY`, `PHYSICAL_*_CONDOR`, `PHYSICAL_IRON_CONDOR`) remain `0x000…000` in r12. The runtime guards in `optionFactory.ts` throw a clear `INVALID_PARAMS` error if any RFQ flow tries to route through one.
- See [`docs/releases/0.2.1.md`](docs/releases/0.2.1.md) for the full per-commit deep-dive, before/after migration code, and verification commands.
