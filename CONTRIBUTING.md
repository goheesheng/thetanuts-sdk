# Contributing to `@thetanuts-finance/thetanuts-client`

Thanks for considering a contribution. This document is the practical guide for getting set up, making changes, and shipping them.

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thetanuts-Finance/thetanuts-sdk.git
cd thetanuts-sdk
npm install
npm run typecheck    # must pass before any commit
npm run lint         # must pass
npm run build        # ESM + CJS + types build clean
npm test             # live mainnet integration suite (Base mainnet)
```

If those four green-light, you're ready to open a PR.

## Project layout

```
src/
  abis/         Inline TypeScript ABIs for every Thetanuts contract.
                Source of truth = the canonical contract artifacts at
                /Users/.../thetaverse/abis/*.json (not in this repo).
                Don't paraphrase — lift verbatim.
  chains/       Chain registry. addresses, tokens, price feeds,
                implementation lookup.
  client/       ThetanutsClient construction + wiring.
  modules/      One file per `client.<name>` surface (optionBook,
                optionFactory, ranger, loan, events, …).
  types/        Shared TypeScript types and error classes.
  utils/        Pure helpers (decimal conversion, error mapping,
                validation, RFQ math).
docs/           GitBook-published user-facing documentation.
                docs/SUMMARY.md is the sidebar.
scripts/        Live mainnet integration tests.
mcp-server/     Optional MCP server wrapping the SDK.
```

## Development workflow

### 1. Branching

Branch off `main`. Use a descriptive branch name (`fix/r12-codex-findings`, `docs/rfq-referrals`, `feat/wheel-vault-multi-chain`). Tagging convention: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `release/`.

### 2. The four required gates

Every PR must pass these locally before review. CI re-runs them.

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint         # eslint src --ext .ts
npm run build        # tsup → ESM + CJS + types
npm test             # scripts/run-mainnet-tests.ts (live Base mainnet)
```

`npm test` hits live mainnet RPC and the indexer API. If you're offline or those are down, document that in the PR.

### 3. Commit messages

Use conventional-commit prefixes: `feat(modules): …`, `fix(abi): …`, `docs: …`, `chore: …`, `release: …`. Multi-line bodies are encouraged for non-trivial changes — explain *why*, not just *what*.

**No `Co-Authored-By` trailers** unless a real human collaborator should be credited. The maintainer prefers clean attribution.

### 4. Pull requests

PRs target `main`. Title matches the leading commit subject. Body should include:

- **Summary** — what changed and why
- **Test plan** — checklist of what you verified
- **Breaking changes** if any, with before/after snippets

For non-trivial changes, run a code-review pass with `/codex challenge` (see [Code review process](#code-review-process) below) before opening the PR — this is what caught the 22 issues in the v0.2.0 → v0.2.1 cycle.

## Working with ABIs

The SDK ships hand-maintained inline ABIs as TypeScript constants (`src/abis/*.ts`). When the protocol contracts change:

1. Get the latest canonical ABI JSONs from the contracts repo (out of band — not vendored here).
2. Diff each function/event signature against the existing inline ABI. Use `jq` to extract specific entries:

   ```bash
   jq '.[] | select(.name == "split")' /path/to/canonical/BaseOption.json
   ```

3. Update the inline TS ABI to match — same field order, same `internalType`, same `stateMutability`, same indexed flags on events.
4. If a function/event signature changed in a way that breaks consumers (parameter rename, new field, changed return shape), update the typed wrapper in `src/modules/<module>.ts` and bump the breaking-change list in `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/resources/migration-guide.md`.

**Never include admin-only contract functions in the SDK ABIs** unless we explicitly want them on the user-facing surface. `setBaseSplitFee`, `withdrawFees` (factory-level), `transferOwnership`, etc. revert for non-owner callers and just confuse the dev.

## Code review process

Every non-trivial PR goes through two review passes:

### Pass 1: codex review

Run `/codex review` (if you use Claude Code with the gstack toolkit) or invoke `codex review --base main` directly. Codex flags issues by priority `[P1]` / `[P2]`. Pass gate if no `[P1]`.

### Pass 2: codex challenge (adversarial)

For changes that touch contract ABIs, payable functions, or zero-address logic, run `/codex challenge` after the review pass. Codex actively tries to break the code — finds new edge cases. The v0.2.1 release fixed 22 issues across three iterative passes; this is what that workflow produces.

### Cross-model heuristic

If both Claude and Codex flag the same line, fix it. If only one flags it, treat it as an opinion — your judgment.

## Releases

The release flow is two PRs:

1. **Code PR** (e.g. `release: v0.2.1 — Base_r12 cutover + codex-found fixes`)
   - Bumps `package.json` version
   - Adds CHANGELOG entry
   - Updates `docs/resources/changelog.md` and `docs/releases/<version>.md` if substantial
   - All four gates green before merge
2. **Doc PR** (e.g. `docs: add v0.2.1 release notes`)
   - Optional but recommended for major releases — full `docs/releases/<version>.md` with per-commit log, before/after migration code, verification commands

After both merge, publish to npm:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
npm whoami                              # confirm you have publish rights
npm pack --dry-run                      # eyeball the tarball contents
npm publish --dry-run --access public   # final preflight
npm publish --access public             # go live (requires 2FA OTP)
git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version> — <subject>"
git push upstream v<version>
```

`prepublishOnly` re-runs the build automatically. Don't manually edit `dist/` — it gets clobbered.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub issue using the bug-report template. Include:

- SDK version (`npm ls @thetanuts-finance/thetanuts-client`)
- Node version
- Chain ID
- Minimal reproduction (the smallest snippet that triggers the bug)
- What you expected vs what happened
- Stack trace if any

For security-sensitive issues, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) — do not open a public issue.

## Style notes

- Default to writing no comments. Only add one when the *why* is non-obvious.
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code.
- Don't reach for new abstractions when three similar lines work.
- TypeScript over JavaScript. No `any` unless it's load-bearing — narrow with type guards.
- Keep modules small. If `src/modules/foo.ts` crosses ~600 lines, that's a signal it's doing too much.
