## OptionBook vs RFQ

The SDK supports two trading systems. Choose based on your use case:

|  | **OptionBook** | **RFQ (Factory)** |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Fill existing market-maker orders | Create custom options via sealed-bid auction |
| **When to use** | Quick trades on listed options (vanilla and multi-leg) | Custom options via sealed-bid auction: any strike, any expiry, cash-settled or physically settled |
| **Structures** | Vanilla, spread, butterfly, condor, iron condor (cash-settled) | Vanilla, spread, butterfly, condor, iron condor (cash-settled or physically settled for vanilla) |
| **Key methods** | `fillOrder()`, `previewFillOrder()` | `buildRFQRequest()`, `requestForQuotation()` |
| **Pricing** | Order prices from `fetchOrders()` | MM pricing from `getAllPricing()` |
| **Data source** | Book indexer (`/api/v1/book/`) | Factory indexer (`/api/v1/factory/`) |
| **User data** | `getUserPositionsFromIndexer()` | `getUserRfqs()`, `getUserOptionsFromRfq()` |
| **Stats** | `getBookProtocolStats()`, `getBookDailyStats()` | `getFactoryProtocolStats()`, `getFactoryDailyStats()` |
| **Collateral** | Paid upfront by taker | `collateralAmount = 0` (held by factory) |
| **Settlement** | Cash-settled (payout in USDC/WETH/cbBTC based on price difference at expiry) | Cash-settled by default; physically settled optional via `buildPhysicalOptionRFQ()` |

## Which one should I use?

Both OptionBook and RFQ create cash-settled options using the same on-chain contracts. The difference is how you get there:

```
Is there an existing order that matches your trade?
  YES --> Use OptionBook (instant fill, no waiting)
  NO  --> Use RFQ (custom strike/expiry, MMs compete on price)

Need physical settlement (actual token delivery at expiry)?
  YES --> Use RFQ with buildPhysicalOptionRFQ()
  NO  --> Either works. OptionBook is faster if an order exists.
```

**OptionBook** is like a limit order book. Makers have already posted orders with set strikes, expiries, and prices. You pick one and fill it instantly.

**RFQ** is like sending out a request for bids. You specify what you want (any strike, any expiry), and market makers compete via sealed-bid auction. It takes ~60 seconds for offers to arrive, but you get competitive pricing on exactly the parameters you need.
