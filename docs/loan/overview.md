# Loan Module

Borrow USDC against ETH or BTC collateral with no liquidation risk. At expiry, repay and reclaim your collateral, or walk away and keep the USDC.

## How It Works

The Loan module wraps the LoanCoordinator contract, which uses Thetanuts V4 physically-settled call options under the hood. The flow:

1. **Deposit collateral** (WETH or cbBTC) and specify a strike price and expiry
2. **Market makers compete** to fill your loan via a sealed-bid RFQ auction
3. **Receive USDC** minus borrowing costs (option premium + interest + protocol fee)
4. **At expiry**, choose to exercise (repay USDC, get collateral back) or walk away (keep USDC, forfeit collateral)

No margin calls. No liquidation. Your collateral is locked in a smart contract, not lent out.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { ThetanutsClient } from '@thetanuts-finance/thetanuts-client';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://mainnet.base.org');
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, provider);
const client = new ThetanutsClient({ chainId: 8453, provider, signer });

// 1. Browse available strike/expiry combinations
const groups = await client.loan.getStrikeOptions('ETH');
const firstOption = groups[0].options[0];

// 2. Calculate exact loan costs
const calc = client.loan.calculateLoan({
  depositAmount: '1.0',
  underlying: 'ETH',
  strike: firstOption.strike,
  expiryTimestamp: firstOption.expiry,
  askPrice: firstOption.askPrice,
  underlyingPrice: firstOption.underlyingPrice,
});

console.log(`Receive: ${calc.formatted.receive} USDC`);
console.log(`Repay:   ${calc.formatted.repay} USDC`);
console.log(`APR:     ${calc.formatted.apr}%`);

// 3. Request the loan
const result = await client.loan.requestLoan({
  underlying: 'ETH',
  collateralAmount: '1.0',
  strike: firstOption.strike,
  expiryTimestamp: firstOption.expiry,
  minSettlementAmount: calc.finalLoanAmount,
});

console.log(`Loan ID: ${result.quotationId}`);
```

## Loan Cost Formula

All costs are computed in USDC (6 decimals) using BigInt arithmetic:

```
OWE = depositAmount * strike / 10^(collateralDecimals + 8 - 6)
optionCost = askPrice * underlyingPrice * depositAmount / 10^collateralDecimals
capitalCost = OWE * (APR / 100) * durationInYears    (min 0.01 USDC)
protocolFee = OWE * 4 / 10000                         (4 basis points)
finalAmount = OWE - optionCost - capitalCost - protocolFee
```

### Promotional Pricing

Loans qualifying for promo get reduced costs:
- **Eligibility:** >90 days to expiry AND <50% LTV (strike/underlyingPrice)
- **Benefits:** Option premium waived, borrowing rate fixed at 5.68% APR
- **Limits:** $250,000 per person, $2,000,000 total pool
